	abstract = {Numerous studies have tracked people's everyday use of digital devices, but without consideration of how such data might be of personal interest to the user. We have developed a personal tracking application that enables users to automatically monitor their 'screen time' on mobile devices ({iOS} and Android) and computers (Mac and Windows). The application interface enables users to combine screen time data from multiple devices. We trialled the application for 28+ days with 21 users, collecting log data and interviewing each user. We found that there is interest in personal tracking in this area, but that the study participants were less interested in quantifying their overall screen time than in gaining data about their use of specific devices and applications. We found that personal tracking of device use is desirable for goals including: increasing productivity, disciplining device use, and cutting down on use.},

	abstract = {This paper characterises the use of activity trackers as "lived informatics". This characterisation is contrasted with other discussions of personal informatics and the quantified self. The paper reports an interview study with activity tracker users. The study found: people do not logically organise, but interweave various activity trackers, sometimes with ostensibly the same functionality; that tracking is often social and collaborative rather than personal; that there are different styles of tracking, including goal driven tracking and documentary tracking; and that tracking information is often used and interpreted with reference to daily or short term goals and decision making. We suggest there will be difficulties in personal informatics if we ignore the way that personal tracking is enmeshed with everyday life and people's outlook on their future.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICPC.2019.00050},
	abstract = {Code comprehension has been recently investigated from physiological and cognitive perspectives using medical imaging devices. Floyd et al. (i.e., the original study) used {fMRI} to classify the type of comprehension tasks performed by developers and relate their results to their expertise. We replicate the original study using lightweight biometrics sensors. Our study participants-28 undergrads in computer science-performed comprehension tasks on source code and natural language prose. We developed machine learning models to automatically identify what kind of tasks developers are working on leveraging their brain-, heart-, and skin-related signals. The best improvement over the original study performance is achieved using solely the heart signal obtained through a single device ({BAC} 87\%vs. 79.1\%). Differently from the original study, we did not observe a correlation between the participants' expertise and the classifier performance (Ï„= 0.16, p= 0.31). Our findings show that lightweight biometric sensors can be used to accurately recognize comprehension opening interesting scenarios for research and practice.},
