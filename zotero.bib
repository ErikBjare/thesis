	abstract = {Numerous studies have tracked people's everyday use of digital devices, but without consideration of how such data might be of personal interest to the user. We have developed a personal tracking application that enables users to automatically monitor their 'screen time' on mobile devices ({iOS} and Android) and computers (Mac and Windows). The application interface enables users to combine screen time data from multiple devices. We trialled the application for 28+ days with 21 users, collecting log data and interviewing each user. We found that there is interest in personal tracking in this area, but that the study participants were less interested in quantifying their overall screen time than in gaining data about their use of specific devices and applications. We found that personal tracking of device use is desirable for goals including: increasing productivity, disciplining device use, and cutting down on use.},

The paper reports an interview study with activity tracker users. The study found: people do not logically organise, but interweave various activity trackers, sometimes with ostensibly the same functionality; that tracking is often social and collaborative rather than personal; that there are different styles of tracking, including goal driven tracking and documentary tracking; and that tracking information is often used and interpreted with reference to daily or short term goals and decision making. We suggest there will be difficulties in personal informatics if we ignore the way that personal tracking is enmeshed with everyday life and people's outlook on their future.},

We developed machine learning models to automatically identify what kind of tasks developers are working on leveraging their brain-, heart-, and skin-related signals. The best improvement over the original study performance is achieved using solely the heart signal obtained through a single device ({BAC} 87\%vs. 79.1\%). Differently from the original study, we did not observe a correlation between the participants' expertise and the classifier performance (τ= 0.16, p= 0.31).

Two-stage least squares regressions were performed to simultaneously test the reciprocal relationship between frequency of Internet use (i.e., hours per day) and three sets of community engagement behaviors: informal social interaction, attendance at public events, and participation in civic volunteerism (i.e., annual frequency). Time spent online has a positive relationship with public attendance and civic volunteerism. No evidence of time displacement from frequency of Internet use is observed.},

Although considerable effort has been devoted to evaluating classifiers using public datasets, more attention to real-time signal processing issues and to optimizing the mutually adaptive interaction between the brain and the {BCI} are essential for improving {BCI} performance. Further development of applications is also needed, particularly applications of {BCI} technology to rehabilitation.

	abstract = {One of the most important issues for the development of a motor-imagery based brain-computer interface ({BCI}) is how to design a powerful classifier with strong generalization capability. Extreme learning machine ({ELM}) has recently proven to be comparable or more efficient than support vector machine for many pattern recognition problems. In this study, we propose a multi-kernel {ELM} ({MKELM})-based method for motor imagery electroencephalogram ({EEG}) classification. The kernel extension of {ELM} provides an elegant way to circumvent calculation of the hidden layer outputs and inherently encode it in a kernel matrix. We investigate effects of two different kernel functions (i.e., Gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel) on the performance of kernel {ELM}. The {MKELM} method is subsequently developed by integrating these two types of kernels with a multi-kernel learning strategy, which can effectively explore the supplementary information from multiple nonlinear feature spaces for more robust classification of {EEG}. An extensive experimental comparison with two public {EEG} datasets indicates that the {MKELM} method gives higher classification accuracy than those of the other competing algorithms. The experimental results confirm that superiority of the proposed {MKELM}-based method for accurate classification of {EEG} associated with motor imagery in {BCI} applications. Our method also provides a promising and generalized solution to investigate the complex and nonlinear information for various applications in the fields of expert and intelligent systems.},

As they use electroencephalography ({EEG}) as non-invasive method for recording neural signals, the application of gel-based {EEG} is time-consuming and cumbersome. In order to achieve a more user-friendly system, this work explores the usability of dry {EEG} electrodes with a {VEP}-based {BCI}. While the results show a high variability between subjects, they also show that communication speeds of more than 100 bit/min are possible using dry {EEG} electrodes. To reduce performance variability and deal with the lower signal-to-noise ratio of the dry {EEG} electrodes, an averaging method and a dynamic stopping method were introduced to the {BCI} system. Those changes were shown to improve performance significantly, leading to an average classification accuracy of 76\% with an average communication speed of 46 bit/min, which is equivalent to a writing speed of 8.8 error-free letters per minute. Although the {BCI} system works substantially better with gel-based {EEG}, dry {EEG} electrodes are more user-friendly and still allow high-speed {BCI} communication.},

	abstract = {Emotions are states in feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influences thought, behaviour and action. A person’s true affective state can be hidden with words and action. Analysing a person’s brainwaves can reveal their affective state. This project makes use of two different stimuli types, still images with audio ({IA} clips) and movie clips. The objective of this project is to find out the accuracy of classifying emotions into six different classes. This project will also determine the effect of different stimuli types as well as the different orders of stimuli type on the effectiveness of elicitation of emotion. There will be two different orders of stimuli type. The first is movie clips followed by {IA} clips, called the {MIA} session. The second is {IA} clips followed by movie clips, called the {IAM} session. 
 
The data collection for this project was done in the Recording Room in Lee Wee Nam Library to minimise outside distraction and for maximum noise isolation. This project uses support vector machine ({SVM}) classification to classify the emotions of each participant using their electroencephalogram ({EEG}) signals. Using {SVM} with radial basis function ({RBF}) kernel and feature smoothing using moving mean, this project found the best window size as well as moving mean window sizes to use for this dataset.  
 
This project found that the session type affects the results of the classification and that it was better to use a single stimuli type at a time than a combination of both. In other words, it is better to use just movie clips or just {IA} clips rather than a combination of both movie clips and {IA} clips as stimuli. It was also discovered that the first stimuli type of each session yields slightly better results than the second, and could be due to the participants losing concentration over the duration of the data collection.},

We found a significant positive relationship with stress and daily time spent on computers. Stress is positively associated with the amount of multitasking. Conversely, stress is negatively associated with Facebook and social media use. Heavy multitaskers use significantly more social media and report lower positive affect than light multitaskers. Night habits affect multitasking the following day: late-nighters show longer duration of computer use and those ending their activities earlier in the day multitask less. Our study shows that college students multitask at double the frequency compared to studies of information workers. These results can inform designs for stress management of college students.},

We find that the neural representations of programming languages vs. natural languages are distinct. We can classify which task a participant is undertaking based solely on brain activity (balanced accuracy 79\%, p {\textless}; 0.001). Further, we find that the same set of brain regions distinguish between code and prose (near-perfect correlation, r = 0.99, p {\textless}; 0.001). Finally, we find that task distinctions are modulated by expertise, such that greater skill predicts a less differentiated neural representation (r = -0.44, p = 0.016) indicating that more skilled participants treat code and prose more similarly at a neural activation level.},

In the present study, we concurrently measure and discriminate {fNIRS} signals evoked by three different mental activities, that is, mental arithmetic ({MA}), right-hand motor imagery ({RI}), and left-hand motor imagery ({LI}). Ten healthy subjects were asked to perform the {MA}, {RI}, and {LI} during a 10s task period. Using a continuous-wave {NIRS} system, signals were acquired concurrently from the prefrontal and the primary motor cortices. Multiclass linear discriminant analysis was utilized to classify {MA} vs. {RI} vs. {LI} with an average classification accuracy of 75.6\% across the ten subjects, for a 2–7s time window during the a 10s task period. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a three-class {fNIRS}-{BCI} using three different intentionally-generated cognitive tasks as inputs.},

The deep learning techniques are explored to improve the performance of traditional feature-based approaches. Specifically, a novel convolutional neural network ({CNN}) framework is proposed for time series classification. Different from other feature-based classification approaches, {CNN} can discover and extract the suitable internal structure to generate deep features of the input time series automatically by using convolution and pooling operations. Two groups of experiments are conducted on simulated data sets and eight groups of experiments are conducted on real-world data sets from different application domains. The final experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series classification in terms of the classification accuracy and noise tolerance.},

Although it has attracted great interests during last decades, it remains a challenging task and falls short of efficiency due to the nature of its data: high dimensionality, large in data size and updating continuously. With the advent of deep learning, new methods have been developed, especially Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) models. In this paper, we present a review of our time series {CNN} approaches including: (i) a data-level approach based on encoding time series into frequency-domain signals via the Stockwell transform, (ii) an algorithm-level approach based on an adaptive convolutional layer filter that suits the time series in hand, and (iii) another algorithm-level approach adapted to time series classification tasks with limited annotated data, which is a global, fast and light-weight framework based on a transfer learning technique with a source learning task similar or different but related to the target learning task. These approaches are implemented on identifying human activities including normal movements of typical subjects and disorder-related movements such as stereotypical motor movements of autistic subjects. Experimental results show that our approaches improve performance of time series classification.},

	abstract = {Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (deep {ConvNets}) has revolutionized computer vision through end-to-end learning, that is, learning from the raw data. There is increasing interest in using deep {ConvNets} for end-to-end {EEG} analysis, but a better understanding of how to design and train {ConvNets} for end-to-end {EEG} decoding and how to visualize the informative {EEG} features the {ConvNets} learn is still needed. Here, we studied deep {ConvNets} with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executed tasks from raw {EEG}. Our results show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted the deep {ConvNets} decoding performance, reaching at least as good performance as the widely used filter bank common spatial patterns ({FBCSP}) algorithm (mean decoding accuracies 82.1\% {FBCSP}, 84.0\% deep {ConvNets}). While {FBCSP} is designed to use spectral power modulations, the features used by {ConvNets} are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing the learned features demonstrated that {ConvNets} indeed learned to use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta, and high gamma frequencies, and proved useful for spatially mapping the learned features by revealing the topography of the causal contributions of features in different frequency bands to the decoding decision. Our study thus shows how to design and train {ConvNets} to decode task-related information from the raw {EEG} without handcrafted features and highlights the potential of deep {ConvNets} combined with advanced visualization techniques for {EEG}-based brain mapping.

	abstract = {Traditional machine learning methods suffer from severe overfitting in {EEG}-based emotion reading. In this paper, we use hierarchical convolutional neural network ({HCNN}) to classify the positive, neutral, and negative emotion states. We organize differential entropy features from different channels as two-dimensional maps to train the {HCNNs}. This approach maintains information in the spatial topology of electrodes. We use stacked autoencoder ({SAE}), {SVM}, and {KNN} as competing methods. {HCNN} yields the highest accuracy, and {SAE} is slightly inferior. Both of them show absolute advantage over traditional shallow models including {SVM} and {KNN}. We confirm that the high-frequency wave bands Beta and Gamma are the most suitable bands for emotion reading. We visualize the hidden layers of {HCNNs} to investigate the feature transformation flow along the hierarchical structure. Benefiting from the strong representational learning capacity in the two-dimensional space, {HCNN} is efficient in emotion recognition especially on Beta and Gamma waves.},

With the advent of brain-computer interface research, the idea of affective brain-computer interfaces ({aBCI}), enabling affect detection from brain signals, arose. In this article, we set out to survey the field of neurophysiology-based affect detection. We outline possible applications of {aBCI} in a general taxonomy of brain-computer interface approaches and introduce the core concepts of affect and their neurophysiological fundamentals. We show that there is a growing body of literature that evidences the capabilities, but also the limitations and challenges of affect detection from neurophysiological activity.},
