 - Ask subject how they are feeling
   - Any standardized way?
   - States to ask about: tired, calm, focused, happy, sad

During experiment:

 - Put in the EEG device
 - Do a signal check
 - Ask them to fixate
 - Run codeprose task

After experiment (debrief):

 - Ask subject how they are feeling again
