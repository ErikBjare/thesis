\section{Conclusions}

Our results show that it is possible to distinguish between reading code and prose, and improves upon the state of the art in this regard.

Furthermore, our naturalistic experiments indicate it is possible to distinguish many other device activities from each other using consumer-grade EEG devices. Among these some data seems to suggest that EEG is sufficient to not only pick up differences in code vs prose \emph{comprehension} but also \emph{writing}.
