We investigate the ability of EEG to distinguish between different activities users engage in on their devices, building on previous research which showed a considerable difference in brain activity between code- and prose-comprehension, as well as differences during code- and prose-synthesis. We explore multiple classification approaches, including using bandpass features, Riemannian geometry, and deep learning.

We also use the automated time tracking application ActivityWatch to track what device activities the user is engaging in. This lets us label EEG data with naturalistic device activity, which we then use to train classifiers of device activity.
