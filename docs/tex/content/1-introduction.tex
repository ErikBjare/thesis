The productivity of software engineers...

Quantified Self movement has risen to the challenge of collecting and analyzing highly personal data for insights into our own lives. But while collecting external data, such as steps taken, physical location, has proven easy and generally considered a solved problem, it's more difficult to collect data on ones internal state (like mood, productivity, what one is thinking about), often requiring manual data collection, or approximations from other external data.

% Move 2 establish a niche (show why there needs to be further research on your topic)

Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have become available as consumer goods, thanks to the economic viability of brain imaging techniques like electroencephalography (EEG). These devices promise to measure different aspects of your mental state: wether you're grasping an object, or how calm you are during your meditation session. Low-cost brain imaging technologies like EEG are therefore suitable as candidates for richer collection about the user's mental state.

% Move 3 introduce the current research (make hypotheses; state the research questions)
