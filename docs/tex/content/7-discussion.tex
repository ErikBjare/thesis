\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Threats to validity}

    During out work we've considered several potential threats to validity. Some of these arise from our limited and biased dataset, while others are about the task and methodology.

    Starting with our dataset, we collected on mostly right-handed late 20s males. This uniform sample may lead to less data needed to train a classifier for that particular group, but doesn't necessarily generalize well to the population at large.

    Among our considerations, a significant threat to the validity is the stimuli images themselves (as seen in figure~\ref{fig:1020}). 

    As an example, the two classes of stimuli differ in more ways than merely being code or prose. Examples of such differences are the background color, the difference in eye saccades while reading (eyes jump around more during the code tasks, where the user may have to jump between the code and the question about it). We haven't been able to discard the possibility that the front-heavy electrode placements (with reference electrode at Fpz) lead to much of the signal being from eye saccades. 

    Future research could evaluate this further either by using an eye tracker or by using an EEG device with different placements of both the electrodes and reference electrode.

\subsection{Ethical considerations}

    When studying EEG data a range of ethical considerations arise. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Could the data be considered personally identifiable information (PII)? 
        \item How privacy sensitive are EEG recordings? Could they contain something the subject would rather keep private? (could have medical implications)
    \end{itemize}

    Companies such as Neurosity have taken an approach with their products where all the processing happens on-device, and only aggregates and classifier outputs are sent to the cloud for storage and presentation to the user.

\subsection{Democratization of neuroscience}

    \add[inline]{Write about democratization efforts, like eeg-notebooks, and how it fits into the larger picture of EEG equipment becoming cheap and widely available.}

    This thesis was made possible due to the efforts of individuals and communities such as NeuroTechX to democratize neuroscience. Indeed, it is the explicit goal of the NeuroTechX eeg-notebooks project to `democratize the neuroscience experiment'. Combined with the rapid cost reduction of research-grade EEG equipment over the last decade it has enabled any programmer to design and perform high-quality neuroscience experiments.

    As development of BCIs advance and the consumer market for EEG devices grow (as evidenced by new devices being released with a regular cadence by InteraXon and Neurosity) we expect to see more uses and applications of these devices.

    Much of this work was made possible due to the efforts of communities such as NeuroTechX to democratize neuroscience by publishing tools and code for running experiments.

\subsection{Crowdsourcing data}

    Collecting data is a significant time sink for researchers, and efforts to crowdsource data from the general public are difficult for EEG as it still requires access to the equipment, the knowledge to operate it, as well as considerations like signal quality, electrode placement, and other factors that might invalidate the data.

    As part of the thesis work I've contributed to an effort in crowdsourcing EEG data collected from the experiments built in eeg-notebooks using consumer EEG devices like the Muse and OpenBCI\@. The effort, called the \href{https://neurotech-challenge.com/}{NeuroTech Challenge Series} (NTCS), is lead by John Griffiths at the University of Toronto.
