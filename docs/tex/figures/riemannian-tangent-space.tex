    \caption{Schematic representation of the symmetric positive definite matrix manifold, the geometric mean $G$ of two points and the tangent space at $G$. The geometric mean of these points is the midpoint on the geodesic connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$, i.e.\ it minimizes the sum of the two squared distances. The map from the tangent space to the manifold is an exponential map. The inverse map is a logarithmic map.}\label{figure:tangent-space}
