	abstract = {Numerous studies have tracked people's everyday use of digital devices, but without consideration of how such data might be of personal interest to the user. We have developed a personal tracking application that enables users to automatically monitor their 'screen time' on mobile devices ({iOS} and Android) and computers (Mac and Windows). The application interface enables users to combine screen time data from multiple devices. We trialled the application for 28+ days with 21 users, collecting log data and interviewing each user. We found that there is interest in personal tracking in this area, but that the study participants were less interested in quantifying their overall screen time than in gaining data about their use of specific devices and applications. We found that personal tracking of device use is desirable for goals including: increasing productivity, disciplining device use, and cutting down on use.},

The paper reports an interview study with activity tracker users. The study found: people do not logically organise, but interweave various activity trackers, sometimes with ostensibly the same functionality; that tracking is often social and collaborative rather than personal; that there are different styles of tracking, including goal driven tracking and documentary tracking; and that tracking information is often used and interpreted with reference to daily or short term goals and decision making. We suggest there will be difficulties in personal informatics if we ignore the way that personal tracking is enmeshed with everyday life and people's outlook on their future.},

We developed machine learning models to automatically identify what kind of tasks developers are working on leveraging their brain-, heart-, and skin-related signals. The best improvement over the original study performance is achieved using solely the heart signal obtained through a single device ({BAC} 87\%vs. 79.1\%). Differently from the original study, we did not observe a correlation between the participants' expertise and the classifier performance (τ= 0.16, p= 0.31).

Two-stage least squares regressions were performed to simultaneously test the reciprocal relationship between frequency of Internet use (i.e., hours per day) and three sets of community engagement behaviors: informal social interaction, attendance at public events, and participation in civic volunteerism (i.e., annual frequency). Time spent online has a positive relationship with public attendance and civic volunteerism. No evidence of time displacement from frequency of Internet use is observed.},

Although considerable effort has been devoted to evaluating classifiers using public datasets, more attention to real-time signal processing issues and to optimizing the mutually adaptive interaction between the brain and the {BCI} are essential for improving {BCI} performance. Further development of applications is also needed, particularly applications of {BCI} technology to rehabilitation.

	abstract = {One of the most important issues for the development of a motor-imagery based brain-computer interface ({BCI}) is how to design a powerful classifier with strong generalization capability. Extreme learning machine ({ELM}) has recently proven to be comparable or more efficient than support vector machine for many pattern recognition problems. In this study, we propose a multi-kernel {ELM} ({MKELM})-based method for motor imagery electroencephalogram ({EEG}) classification. The kernel extension of {ELM} provides an elegant way to circumvent calculation of the hidden layer outputs and inherently encode it in a kernel matrix. We investigate effects of two different kernel functions (i.e., Gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel) on the performance of kernel {ELM}. The {MKELM} method is subsequently developed by integrating these two types of kernels with a multi-kernel learning strategy, which can effectively explore the supplementary information from multiple nonlinear feature spaces for more robust classification of {EEG}. An extensive experimental comparison with two public {EEG} datasets indicates that the {MKELM} method gives higher classification accuracy than those of the other competing algorithms. The experimental results confirm that superiority of the proposed {MKELM}-based method for accurate classification of {EEG} associated with motor imagery in {BCI} applications. Our method also provides a promising and generalized solution to investigate the complex and nonlinear information for various applications in the fields of expert and intelligent systems.},

As they use electroencephalography ({EEG}) as non-invasive method for recording neural signals, the application of gel-based {EEG} is time-consuming and cumbersome. In order to achieve a more user-friendly system, this work explores the usability of dry {EEG} electrodes with a {VEP}-based {BCI}. While the results show a high variability between subjects, they also show that communication speeds of more than 100 bit/min are possible using dry {EEG} electrodes. To reduce performance variability and deal with the lower signal-to-noise ratio of the dry {EEG} electrodes, an averaging method and a dynamic stopping method were introduced to the {BCI} system. Those changes were shown to improve performance significantly, leading to an average classification accuracy of 76\% with an average communication speed of 46 bit/min, which is equivalent to a writing speed of 8.8 error-free letters per minute. Although the {BCI} system works substantially better with gel-based {EEG}, dry {EEG} electrodes are more user-friendly and still allow high-speed {BCI} communication.},

	abstract = {Emotions are states in feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influences thought, behaviour and action. A person’s true affective state can be hidden with words and action. Analysing a person’s brainwaves can reveal their affective state. This project makes use of two different stimuli types, still images with audio ({IA} clips) and movie clips. The objective of this project is to find out the accuracy of classifying emotions into six different classes. This project will also determine the effect of different stimuli types as well as the different orders of stimuli type on the effectiveness of elicitation of emotion. There will be two different orders of stimuli type. The first is movie clips followed by {IA} clips, called the {MIA} session. The second is {IA} clips followed by movie clips, called the {IAM} session. 
 
The data collection for this project was done in the Recording Room in Lee Wee Nam Library to minimise outside distraction and for maximum noise isolation. This project uses support vector machine ({SVM}) classification to classify the emotions of each participant using their electroencephalogram ({EEG}) signals. Using {SVM} with radial basis function ({RBF}) kernel and feature smoothing using moving mean, this project found the best window size as well as moving mean window sizes to use for this dataset.  
 
This project found that the session type affects the results of the classification and that it was better to use a single stimuli type at a time than a combination of both. In other words, it is better to use just movie clips or just {IA} clips rather than a combination of both movie clips and {IA} clips as stimuli. It was also discovered that the first stimuli type of each session yields slightly better results than the second, and could be due to the participants losing concentration over the duration of the data collection.},

	abstract = {One century after the first recording of human electroencephalographic ({EEG}) signals, {EEG} has become one of the most used neuroimaging techniques. The medical devices industry is now able to produce small and reliable {EEG} systems, enabling a wide variety of applications also with no-clinical aims, providing a powerful tool to neuroscientific research. However, these systems still suffer from a critical limitation, consisting in the use of wet electrodes, that are uncomfortable and require expertise to install and time from the user. In this context, dozens of different concepts of {EEG} dry electrodes have been recently developed, and there is the common opinion that they are reaching traditional wet electrodes quality standards. However, although many papers have tried to validate them in terms of signal quality and usability, a comprehensive comparison of different dry electrode types from multiple points of view is still missing. The present work proposes a comparison of three different dry electrode types, selected among the main solutions at present, against wet electrodes, taking into account several aspects, both in terms of signal quality and usability. In particular, the three types consisted in gold-coated single pin, multiple pins and solid-gel electrodes. The results confirmed the great standards achieved by dry electrode industry, since it was possible to obtain results comparable to wet electrodes in terms of signals spectra and mental states classification, but at the same time drastically reducing the time of montage and enhancing the comfort. In particular, multiple-pins and solid-gel electrodes overcome gold-coated single-pin-based ones in terms of comfort.},

	abstract = {Dry electrode electroencephalogram ({EEG}) recording combined with wireless data transmission offers an alternative tool to conventional wet electrode {EEG} systems. However, the question remains whether the signal quality of dry electrode recordings is comparable to wet electrode recordings in the clinical context. We recorded the resting state {EEG} ({rsEEG}), the visual evoked potentials ({VEP}) and the visual P300 (P3) from 16 healthy subjects (age range: 26–79 years) and 16 neurological patients who reported subjective memory impairment (age range: 50–83 years). Each subject took part in two recordings on different days, one with 19 dry electrodes and another with 19 wet electrodes. They reported their preferred {EEG} system. Comparisons of the {rsEEG} recordings were conducted qualitatively by independent visual evaluation by two neurologists blinded to the {EEG} system used and quantitatively by spectral analysis of the {rsEEG}. The P100 visual evoked potential ({VEP}) and P3 event-related potential ({ERP}) were compared in terms of latency, amplitude and pre-stimulus noise. The majority of subjects preferred the dry electrode headset. Both neurologists reported that all {rsEEG} traces were comparable between the wet and dry electrode headsets. Absolute Alpha and Beta power during rest did not statistically differ between the two {EEG} systems (p {\textgreater} 0.05 in all cases). However, Theta and Delta power was slightly higher with the dry electrodes (p = 0.0004 for Theta and p  0.10 in all cases) with a similar spatial distribution for both wet and dry electrode systems. These results suggest that the signal quality, ease of set-up and portability of the dry electrode {EEG} headset used in our study comply with the needs of clinical applications.},

We logged computer activity and used biosensors to measure stress of 48 students for 7 days for all waking hours, in their in situ environments. We found a significant positive relationship with stress and daily time spent on computers. Stress is positively associated with the amount of multitasking. Conversely, stress is negatively associated with Facebook and social media use. Heavy multitaskers use significantly more social media and report lower positive affect than light multitaskers. Night habits affect multitasking the following day: late-nighters show longer duration of computer use and those ending their activities earlier in the day multitask less. Our study shows that college students multitask at double the frequency compared to studies of information workers. These results can inform designs for stress management of college students.},

We find that the neural representations of programming languages vs. natural languages are distinct. We can classify which task a participant is undertaking based solely on brain activity (balanced accuracy 79\%, p {\textless}; 0.001). Further, we find that the same set of brain regions distinguish between code and prose (near-perfect correlation, r = 0.99, p {\textless}; 0.001). Finally, we find that task distinctions are modulated by expertise, such that greater skill predicts a less differentiated neural representation (r = -0.44, p = 0.016) indicating that more skilled participants treat code and prose more similarly at a neural activation level.},

Different from other feature-based classification approaches, {CNN} can discover and extract the suitable internal structure to generate deep features of the input time series automatically by using convolution and pooling operations. Two groups of experiments are conducted on simulated data sets and eight groups of experiments are conducted on real-world data sets from different application domains.

Although it has attracted great interests during last decades, it remains a challenging task and falls short of efficiency due to the nature of its data: high dimensionality, large in data size and updating continuously. With the advent of deep learning, new methods have been developed, especially Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) models. In this paper, we present a review of our time series {CNN} approaches including: (i) a data-level approach based on encoding time series into frequency-domain signals via the Stockwell transform, (ii) an algorithm-level approach based on an adaptive convolutional layer filter that suits the time series in hand, and (iii) another algorithm-level approach adapted to time series classification tasks with limited annotated data, which is a global, fast and light-weight framework based on a transfer learning technique with a source learning task similar or different but related to the target learning task. These approaches are implemented on identifying human activities including normal movements of typical subjects and disorder-related movements such as stereotypical motor movements of autistic subjects. Experimental results show that our approaches improve performance of time series classification.},

	abstract = {Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (deep {ConvNets}) has revolutionized computer vision through end-to-end learning, that is, learning from the raw data. There is increasing interest in using deep {ConvNets} for end-to-end {EEG} analysis, but a better understanding of how to design and train {ConvNets} for end-to-end {EEG} decoding and how to visualize the informative {EEG} features the {ConvNets} learn is still needed. Here, we studied deep {ConvNets} with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executed tasks from raw {EEG}. Our results show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted the deep {ConvNets} decoding performance, reaching at least as good performance as the widely used filter bank common spatial patterns ({FBCSP}) algorithm (mean decoding accuracies 82.1\% {FBCSP}, 84.0\% deep {ConvNets}). While {FBCSP} is designed to use spectral power modulations, the features used by {ConvNets} are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing the learned features demonstrated that {ConvNets} indeed learned to use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta, and high gamma frequencies, and proved useful for spatially mapping the learned features by revealing the topography of the causal contributions of features in different frequency bands to the decoding decision. Our study thus shows how to design and train {ConvNets} to decode task-related information from the raw {EEG} without handcrafted features and highlights the potential of deep {ConvNets} combined with advanced visualization techniques for {EEG}-based brain mapping.

We use stacked autoencoder ({SAE}), {SVM}, and {KNN} as competing methods. {HCNN} yields the highest accuracy, and {SAE} is slightly inferior. Both of them show absolute advantage over traditional shallow models including {SVM} and {KNN}. We confirm that the high-frequency wave bands Beta and Gamma are the most suitable bands for emotion reading. We visualize the hidden layers of {HCNNs} to investigate the feature transformation flow along the hierarchical structure. Benefiting from the strong representational learning capacity in the two-dimensional space, {HCNN} is efficient in emotion recognition especially on Beta and Gamma waves.},

Yet, despite a long-standing pursuit in human-computer interaction ({HCI}) for design strategies that foster sustained engagement, behavior change and wellbeing, the basic psychological needs shown to mediate these outcomes are rarely taken into account. This is possibly due to the lack of a clear model to explain these needs in the context of {HCI}. Herein we introduce such a model: Motivation, Engagement and Thriving in User Experience ({METUX}). The model provides a framework grounded in psychological research that can allow {HCI} researchers and practitioners to form actionable insights with respect to how technology designs support or undermine basic psychological needs, thereby increasing motivation and engagement, and ultimately, improving user wellbeing. We propose that in order to address wellbeing, psychological needs must be considered within five different spheres of analysis including: at the point of technology adoption, during interaction with the interface, as a result of engagement with technology-specific tasks, as part of the technology-supported behavior, and as part of an individual’s life overall. These five spheres of experience sit within a sixth, society, which encompasses both direct and collateral effects of technology use as well as non-user experiences. We build this model based on existing evidence for basic psychological need satisfaction, including evidence within the context of the workplace, computer games, and health. We extend and hone these ideas to provide practical advice for designers along with real world examples of how to apply the model to design practice.},

After a first training session, participants will visit the lab twice in separate weeks, during which they will orally consume one capsule containing 200mg of caffeine, and one capsule containing a placebo substance (double-blind and random order of administration). {EEG} will be measured before and after capsule consumption, and cognitive control tasks will be administered after capsule consumption. Generally, the investigators expect that caffeine will decrease {TBR} and thereby increase cognitive control. Additionally, the investigators expect that individual differences in baseline frontal (reflected by {TBR}) and central dopaminergic (reflected by spontaneously-measured eye-blink rates; {EBR}) activity will moderate the relationship between caffeine and cognitive control. Furthermore, the effects of caffeine on specifically hypervigilance for threatening distractors (taking into account a possible moderating role of trait anxiety) were examined as a separate research question.},

	abstract = {Lab-based electroencephalography ({EEG}) techniques have matured over decades of research and can produce high-quality scientific data. It is often assumed that the specific choice of {EEG} system has limited impact on the data and does not add variance to the results. However, many low cost and mobile {EEG} systems are now available, and there is some doubt as to the how {EEG} data vary across these newer systems. We sought to determine how variance across systems compares to variance across subjects or repeated sessions. We tested four {EEG} systems: two standard research-grade systems, one system designed for mobile use with dry electrodes, and an affordable mobile system with a lower channel count. We recorded four subjects three times with each of the four {EEG} systems. This setup allowed us to assess the influence of all three factors on the variance of data. Subjects performed a battery of six short standard {EEG} paradigms based on event-related potentials ({ERPs}) and steady-state visually evoked potential ({SSVEP}). Results demonstrated that subjects account for 32\% of the variance, systems for 9\% of the variance, and repeated sessions for each subject-system combination for 1\% of the variance. In most lab-based {EEG} research, the number of subjects per study typically ranges from 10 to 20, and error of uncertainty in estimates of the mean (like {ERP}) will improve by the square root of the number of subjects. As a result, the variance due to {EEG} system (9\%) is of the same order of magnitude as variance due to subjects (32\% / sqrt(16) = 8\%) with a pool of 16 subjects. The two standard research-grade {EEG} systems had no significantly different means from each other across all paradigms. However, the two other {EEG} systems demonstrated different mean values from one or both of the two standard research-grade {EEG} systems in at least half of the paradigms. In addition to providing specific estimates of the variability across {EEG} systems, subjects, and repeated sessions, we also propose a benchmark to evaluate new mobile {EEG} systems by means of {ERP} responses.},

	abstract = {Ear-{EEG} allows to record brain activity in every-day life, for example to study natural behaviour or unhindered social interactions. Compared to conventional scalp-{EEG}, ear-{EEG} uses fewer electrodes and covers only a small part of the head. Consequently, ear-{EEG} will be less sensitive to some cortical sources. Here, we perform realistic electromagnetic simulations to compare {cEEGrid} ear-{EEG} with 128-channel cap-{EEG}. We compute the sensitivity of ear-{EEG} for different cortical sources, and quantify the expected signal loss of ear-{EEG} relative to cap-{EEG}. Our results show that ear-{EEG} is most sensitive to sources in the temporal cortex. Furthermore, we show how ear-{EEG} benefits from a multi-channel configuration (i.e. {cEEGrid}). The pipelines presented here can be adapted to any arrangement of electrodes and can therefore provide an estimate of sensitivity to cortical regions, thereby increasing the chance of successful experiments using ear-{EEG}.},

	abstract = {Objective. Electroencephalography ({EEG}) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain–computer interfaces, {BCI}’s), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in {EEG} studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large {EEG} data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of {EEG} signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of {EEG} more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to {EEG} classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which {EEG} classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks? Approach. A systematic literature review of {EEG} classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and {PubMed} databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, {EEG} preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture. Main results. For {EEG} classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review. Significance. This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for {EEG} classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to {EEG} datasets in future research.},

	abstract = {Context. Electroencephalography ({EEG}) is a complex signal and can require several years of training, as well as advanced signal processing and feature extraction methodologies to be correctly interpreted. Recently, deep learning ({DL}) has shown great promise in helping make sense of {EEG} signals due to its capacity to learn good feature representations from raw data. Whether {DL} truly presents advantages as compared to more traditional {EEG} processing approaches, however, remains an open question. Objective. In this work, we review 154 papers that apply {DL} to {EEG}, published between January 2010 and July 2018, and spanning different application domains such as epilepsy, sleep, brain–computer interfacing, and cognitive and affective monitoring. We extract trends and highlight interesting approaches from this large body of literature in order to inform future research and formulate recommendations. Methods. Major databases spanning the fields of science and engineering were queried to identify relevant studies published in scientific journals, conferences, and electronic preprint repositories. Various data items were extracted for each study pertaining to (1) the data, (2) the preprocessing methodology, (3) the {DL} design choices, (4) the results, and (5) the reproducibility of the experiments. These items were then analyzed one by one to uncover trends. Results. Our analysis reveals that the amount of {EEG} data used across studies varies from less than ten minutes to thousands of hours, while the number of samples seen during training by a network varies from a few dozens to several millions, depending on how epochs are extracted. Interestingly, we saw that more than half the studies used publicly available data and that there has also been a clear shift from intra-subject to inter-subject approaches over the last few years. About of the studies used convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}), while used recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}), most often with a total of 3–10 layers. Moreover, almost one-half of the studies trained their models on raw or preprocessed {EEG} time series. Finally, the median gain in accuracy of {DL} approaches over traditional baselines was across all relevant studies. More importantly, however, we noticed studies often suffer from poor reproducibility: a majority of papers would be hard or impossible to reproduce given the unavailability of their data and code. Significance. To help the community progress and share work more effectively, we provide a list of recommendations for future studies and emphasize the need for more reproducible research. We also make our summary table of {DL} and {EEG} papers available and invite authors of published work to contribute to it directly. A planned follow-up to this work will be an online public benchmarking portal listing reproducible results.},

Such a task is relevant to diverse domains, where a person is expected or required to be in a particular state of mind. For instance, pilots and medical staff are expected to be in a highly alert state and the proposed method could help to detect possible deviations from this expected state. This work poses a binary classification problem where the goal is to distinguish between a “relaxed” state and a baseline state (“normal”) from the study of electroencephalographic signals ({EEG}) collected with a small number of electrodes. The {EEG} of 58 subjects in the two alertness states (116 records) were collected via a cap with 58 electrodes. After a data validation step, 19 subjects were retained for further analysis. A genetic algorithm was used to select a subset of electrodes. Common spatial pattern ({CSP}) coupled to linear discriminant analysis ({LDA}) was used to build a decision rule and thus predict the alertness of the subjects. Different subset sizes were investigated and the best compromise between the number of selected electrodes and the quality of the solution was obtained by considering 9 electrodes. Even if the present approach is costly in computation time ({GA} search), it allows to construct a decision rule that provides an accurate and fast prediction of the alertness state of an unseen individual.},

	abstract = {The introduction of deep learning and transfer learning techniques in fields such as computer vision allowed a leap forward in the accuracy of image classification tasks. Currently there is only limited use of such techniques in neuroscience. The challenge of using deep learning methods to successfully train models in neuroscience, lies in the complexity of the information that is processed, the availability of data and the cost of producing sufficient high quality annotations. Inspired by its application in computer vision, we introduce transfer learning on electrophysiological data to enable training a model with limited amounts of data. Our method was tested on the dataset of the {BCI} competition {IV} 2a and compared to the top results that were obtained using traditional machine learning techniques. Using our {DL} model we outperform the top result of the competition by 33\%. We also explore transferability of knowledge between trained models over different experiments, called inter-experimental transfer learning. This reduces the amount of required data even further and is especially useful when few subjects are available. This method is able to outperform the standard deep learning methods used in the {BCI} competition {IV} 2b approaches by 18\%. In this project we propose a method that can produce reliable electroencephalography ({EEG}) signal classification, based on modest amounts of training data through the use of transfer learning.},

However, the collection of substantial {EEG} data could be difficult owing to its randomness and non-stationary. Moreover, there is notable individual difference in {EEG} data, which affects the reusability and generalization of models. For mitigating the adverse effects from the above factors, transfer learning is applied in this field to transfer the knowledge learnt in one domain into a different but related domain. Transfer learning adjusts models with small-scale data of the task, and also maintains the learning ability with individual difference. This paper describes four main methods of transfer learning and explores their practical applications in {EEG} signal analysis in recent years.

	abstract = {Brain functioning is severely affected in long-term alcoholics. This degradation is reflected in Electroencephalographic signals({EEG}) which are electrical signals in the brain generated due to the firing of neurons. These signals can be used to understand the changes in the brain of an alcoholic. In this work, Riemann geometry based classification framework is used to study changes in interdependencies across various brain regions in alcoholics. Publicly available data of 50 subjects(25 alcoholics, 25 control) with 10 trials each are used in this work. Spatial covariance matrices for empirically chosen channels are input to two classification scenarios. In the first scenario, covariance matrices are used as features to ”Minimum Distance to Mean classifier with geodesic filtering({fgMDM})” on the manifold. The highest mean accuracy obtained is 82.8\% for the channel set of {AF}2 \& P6. In the second scenario, the covariance matrices are mapped to tangent space and the resultant tangent vectors are used as features for Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel. In this scenario, the highest mean accuracy obtained is 87.6\% for the channel set {FP}1 \& {PO}1. Both scenarios indicate significant changes across frontal lobe in comparison to the posterior lobes of the brain, in alcoholics. Changes in covariance matrices for the {EEG}, when the same stimulus is provided, indicate changes in brain functioning, consistent with alcoholism. Hence, Riemann geometry is a promising framework to study changes in brain region inter-dependencies, for subjects exposed to different brain-altering situations.},

By extracting information from this unlabeled data, it might be possible to reach competitive performance with deep neural networks despite limited access to labels. Approach. We investigated self-supervised learning ({SSL}), a promising technique for discovering structure in unlabeled data, to learn representations of {EEG} signals. Specifically, we explored two tasks based on temporal context prediction as well as contrastive predictive coding on two clinically-relevant problems: {EEG}-based sleep staging and pathology detection. We conducted experiments on two large public datasets with thousands of recordings and performed baseline comparisons with purely supervised and hand-engineered approaches. Main results. Linear classifiers trained on {SSL}-learned features consistently outperformed purely supervised deep neural networks in low-labeled data regimes while reaching competitive performance when all labels were available. Additionally, the embeddings learned with each method revealed clear latent structures related to physiological and clinical phenomena, such as age effects. Significance. We demonstrate the benefit of {SSL} approaches on {EEG} data. Our results suggest that self-supervision may pave the way to a wider use of deep learning models on {EEG} data.},

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate two candidate brain systems: the multiple demand ({MD}) system, typically recruited during math, logic, problem solving, and executive tasks, and the language system, typically recruited during linguistic processing. We examined {MD} and language system responses to code written in Python, a text-based programming language (Experiment 1) and in {ScratchJr}, a graphical programming language (Experiment 2); for both, we contrasted responses to code problems with responses to content-matched sentence problems. We found that the {MD} system exhibited strong bilateral responses to code in both experiments, whereas the language system responded strongly to sentence problems, but weakly or not at all to code problems. Thus, the {MD} system supports the use of novel cognitive tools even when the input is structurally similar to natural language.},

However, to date the validation of the use of low-cost {EEG} systems has focused on continuous recording of {EEG} data and/or the replication of large system {EEG} setups reliant on event-markers to afford examination of event-related brain potentials ({ERP}). Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to conduct {ERP} research without being reliant on event markers using a portable {MUSE} {EEG} system and a single computer. Specifically, we report the results of two experiments using data collected with the {MUSE} {EEG} system—one using the well-known visual oddball paradigm and the other using a standard reward-learning task. Our results demonstrate that we could observe and quantify the N200 and P300 {ERP} components in the visual oddball task and the reward positivity (the mirror opposite component to the feedback-related negativity) in the reward-learning task. Specifically, single sample t-tests of component existence (all p's {\textless} 0.05), computation of Bayesian credible intervals, and 95\% confidence intervals all statistically verified the existence of the N200, P300, and reward positivity in all analyses. We provide with this research paper an open source website with all the instructions, methods, and software to replicate our findings and to provide researchers with an easy way to use the {MUSE} {EEG} system for {ERP} research. Importantly, our work highlights that with a single computer and a portable {EEG} system such as the {MUSE} one can conduct {ERP} research with ease thus greatly extending the possible use of the {ERP} methodology to a variety of novel contexts.},

	abstract = {This experiment employed an individual differences approach to test the hypothesis that learning modern programming languages resembles second “natural” language learning in adulthood. Behavioral and neural (resting-state {EEG}) indices of language aptitude were used along with numeracy and fluid cognitive measures (e.g., fluid reasoning, working memory, inhibitory control) as predictors. Rate of learning, programming accuracy, and post-test declarative knowledge were used as outcome measures in 36 individuals who participated in ten 45-minute Python training sessions. The resulting models explained 50–72\% of the variance in learning outcomes, with language aptitude measures explaining significant variance in each outcome even when the other factors competed for variance. Across outcome variables, fluid reasoning and working-memory capacity explained 34\% of the variance, followed by language aptitude (17\%), resting-state {EEG} power in beta and low-gamma bands (10\%), and numeracy (2\%). These results provide a novel framework for understanding programming aptitude, suggesting that the importance of numeracy may be overestimated in modern programming education environments.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117344},
	abstract = {To what extent electrocorticography ({ECoG}) and electroencephalography (scalp {EEG}) differ in their capability to locate sources of deep brain activity is far from evident. Compared to {EEG}, the spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of {ECoG} is superior but its spatial coverage is more restricted, as is arguably the volume of tissue activity effectively measured from. Moreover, scalp {EEG} studies are providing evidence of locating activity from deep sources such as the hippocampus using high-density setups during quiet wakefulness. To address this question, we recorded a multimodal dataset from 4 patients with refractory epilepsy during quiet wakefulness. This data comprises simultaneous scalp, subdural and depth {EEG} electrode recordings. The latter was located in the hippocampus or insula and provided us with our “ground truth” for source localization of deep activity. We applied independent component analysis ({ICA}) for the purpose of separating the independent sources in theta, alpha and beta frequency band activity. In all patients subdural- and scalp {EEG} components were observed which had a significant zero-lag correlation with one or more contacts of the depth electrodes. Subsequent dipole modeling of the correlating components revealed dipole locations that were significantly closer to the depth electrodes compared to the dipole location of non-correlating components. These findings support the idea that components found in both recording modalities originate from neural activity in close proximity to the depth electrodes. Sources localized with subdural electrodes were {\textasciitilde}70\% closer to the depth electrode than sources localized with {EEG} with an absolute improvement of around {\textasciitilde}2cm. In our opinion, this is not a considerable improvement in source localization accuracy given that, for clinical purposes, {ECoG} electrodes were implanted in close proximity to the depth electrodes. Furthermore, the {ECoG} grid attenuates the scalp {EEG}, due to the electrically isolating silastic sheets in which the {ECoG} electrodes are embedded. Our results on dipole modeling show that the deep source localization accuracy of scalp {EEG} is comparable to that of {ECoG}.
Significance Statement
Deep and subcortical regions play an important role in brain function. However, as joint recordings at multiple spatial scales to study brain function in humans are still scarce, it is still unresolved to what extent {ECoG} and {EEG} differ in their capability to locate sources of deep brain activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study presenting a dataset of simultaneously recorded {EEG}, {ECoG} and depth electrodes in the hippocampus or insula, with a focus on non-epileptiform activity (quiet wakefulness). Furthermore, we are the first study to provide experimental findings on the comparison of source localization of deep cortical structures between invasive and non-invasive brain activity measured from the cortical surface.},

Despite their importance, it is still unclear whether their  neural activity can be recorded non-invasively. Here, using simultaneous intracerebral and magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) recordings in patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy, we demonstrate a direct contribution of amygdala and hippocampal activity to surface {MEG} recordings. In particular, a method of blind source separation, independent component analysis, enabled activity arising from large neocortical networks to be disentangled from that of deeper structures, whose amplitude at the surface was small but significant. This finding is highly relevant for our understanding of hippocampal and amygdala brain activity as it implies that their activity could potentially be measured non-invasively.},

Besides, it seeks to pinpoint research gaps, challenges, and trends. Based on widely known guidelines, a systematic mapping of the literature was designed and run to answer eight research questions. After applying a careful ﬁltering process, we selected 27 representative studies from a sample of 2,084 potentially relevant works retrieved from seven digital libraries. The main results are: a classiﬁcation scheme of the published studies was produced; there is no predominance of the devices used to capture psychophysiological data; over 50\% of the studies have explored indicators related to mental states and neural activity; and 80\% have analyzed composite data to understand the cognitive load and in the context of understanding debugging programs and strategies.
